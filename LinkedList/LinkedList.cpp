//in the main .cpp use CATCH.HPP to test class
#include "catch.hpp"

/*
Requirements:
1. create a struct called Value ( rename and add 6 fields to)
 - note these files test a queue, stack , insertion and search using linked list

 Following operations:
 Queue: first in First out
    - push a val to the back of the list
    - pop a value from the front of the list

Stack: last in first out
    - push a value to the back of the list
    - pop a value from the back of the lsit

Insert and Find:
- keep list in sorted order (use some field of value)
- search for a value in the list
- insert a value at the appropriate place in the list

print the list out.

Notes: 
 for Value Class, might want to base it on a them...
